<p>Hello. I made this website to show how many possible video IDs there are - compared to how little videos there are.<br><br>You can browse in an infinite plane of non-repeating IDs, and you will most likely never ever find a video. And if you do, It'll as lucky as winning the lottery 4200 times in a row.<br><br>You can use WASD controls to move the camera, zoom out with normal website controls, and press R to put the camera at a completely random position. Enjoy uh browsing empty youtube IDs.<br><br><br><br>Maybe one day if I stop being lazy I'll hook this up to the YouTube API making every video in here valid. That'd be way cooler.</p>
